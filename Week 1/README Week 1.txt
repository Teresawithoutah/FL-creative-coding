This directory contains Processing sketches for week 1. Each sketch has its own directory. If you have installed all the code from the zip file in your Processing directory each sketch can be accessed directly from Processing using the “File -> Sketchbook -> Creative Coding” menu.

The sketches are:

w1_01 - draw your name. A simple drawing program that draws randomly sized squares when the mouse if pressed.

w1_02 - draw your name (part 2). A variation on the first draw your name sketch. This one uses time-varying functions to create a different aesthetic.

w1_03 - draw your name (part 3). Another variation, this time chaining the shape drawn over time.

Foldout Sketches
————————————————

These sketches accompany the one page “foldouts”, which give an overview of a topic in a single page.

w1_04_2DGraphics - anatomy of graphics primitives. This sketch shows how drawing works in Processing and shows a number of different graphics primitives and how drawing order affects the image that appears onscreen. Use in conjunction with the w1_04_2DGraphics foldout.

The structure is the same for all 6 weeks.
