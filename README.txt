The files are organised by weeks, with each sketch in a separate sub-folder for the week it is used.

To install just copy the “Creative Coding Sketches” directory into the “Processing” folder inside your “Documents” folder. You should then be able to access all the sketches from within Processing, via the File -> Sketchbook menu.

All the sketches are released under a GPLv3 open source license. Please see the attached License.rtf for full details of the License. The files are Copyrighted by the authors, but you are free to modify and distribute them provided you include the original copyright message and GPLv3 License information.
